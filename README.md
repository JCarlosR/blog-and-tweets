## About this project

This is a simple web application that allows the users to:

- publish articles, 
- manage their content, 
- have a profile page, 
- and connect their Twitter accounts.

Users can load their profile image from Twitter and so their tweets. 

They even can decide what tweets they want to show (hide or un-hide).

## Laravel: Project excercise

The idea is to practice Laravel, using framework concepts while developing this project.

Actually this is the solution for a proposed [excercise described here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUgBE5igkZY).

Vue.js was also applied for the tweets section.

Using Fetch (asynchronous requests), they allow the users to change their tweets visibility without reloading the page.
